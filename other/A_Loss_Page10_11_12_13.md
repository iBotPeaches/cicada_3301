A Loss of Divinity
The Circumference practices three behaviors which cause the loss of divinity

Consumption
We consume too much because we believe the following two errors within the deception:

1. We do not have enough or there is not enough
2. We have what we have now by luck

and we will not be strong enough later to obtain what we need.
Most things are not worth consuming.

Preservation
We preserve things because we believe we are weak.
If we lose them, we will not be strong enough to gain them again.
This is the deception.
Most things are not worth preserving.

Adherence
We follow dogma so that we can belong and be right
or we follow reason so we can belong and be right.
There is nothing to be right about
to belong is death
it is the behaviors of consumption

Preservation and Adherence that have us lose our Primality
and thus our Divinity

Some wisdom
Amass great wealth
Never become attached to what you own
Be prepared to destroy all that you own

An instruction
Program your mind
Program reality
```

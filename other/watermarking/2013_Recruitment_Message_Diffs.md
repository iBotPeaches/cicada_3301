Congratulations.  Your testing has finally come to an end.  We hope you have enjoyed
the "vacation" over the last few weeks.  You will be very busy now should you choose
to join us.

There are two final steps, although there won't be any hidden codes, or secret messages,
or physical treasure hunts.  This first of these is only honesty.  We have always been
honest with you, and we shall continue to be honest with you.  And we expect you to be
honest with us in return.

You have all wondered who we are, and so we shall now tell you : We are an international
group.  We have no name.  We have no symbol.  We have no membership rosters.  We do not
have a public website, and we do not advertise ourselves.  We are a group of individuals
who have proven ourselves.  Much like you have by completing this recruitment contest.
And we are drawn together by common beliefs.  A careful reading of the texts used in
the contest would have revealed some of these beliefs : that tyranny and oppression
of any kind must end; that censorship is wrong; and that privacy is an inalienable right.

We are not a "hacker" group.  Nor are we a "warez" group.  We do not engage in illegal
activity, nor do our members.  If you are engaged in illegal activity, we ask that you
cease any and all illegal activities or decline membership at this time.  We will not
ask questions if you decline; however, if you lie to us we will find out.

You are undoubtedly wondering what it is that we do.  We are much like a "Think Tank" in
that our primary focus is on researching and developing techniques to aid the ideas we
advocate : liberty, privacy, security.  You have undoubtedly heard of a few of our past
projects.  And if you choose to accept membership, we are happy to have you on board to
help with future projects.

Please answer the next few questions, and send your encrypted responses to
c1231507051321@gmail.com

* Do you believe that every human being has a right to privacy and anonymity, and is within
  their rights to use tools which help obtain and maintain privacy : i.e., cash, strong
  encryption, anonymity software, etc?

* Do you believe that information should be free?

* Do you believe that censorship harms humanity?


We look forward to hearing from you.

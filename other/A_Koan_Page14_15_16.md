A Koan
During a lesson the master explained the I:

"The I is the voice of the circumference" he said.

When asked by a student to explain what that meant,
the master said, "It is a voice inside your head."

"I don't have a voice in my head," thought the student
and he raised his hand to tell the master.

The master stopped the student and said: "The voice 
that just said you have no voice in your head is the I."
and the students were enlightened.

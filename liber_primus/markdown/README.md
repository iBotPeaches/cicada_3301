# Text iteration of Liber Primus

* We match the formatting of the page (spacing, newlines) instead of the disassembled message.
* We prefer uppercase English letters - summarization pages can use standard case.
* Dots become spaces and newlines are represented as newlines.
* We put red text in a section below.
* Paste raw output of tool usage so we can remember the exact command used.
* If an Outguess payload exists - we link to it.

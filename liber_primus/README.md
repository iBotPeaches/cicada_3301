# Image iteration of Liber Primus

* The first 17 pages (0-16) were part of the linear 2014 Puzzle, commonly referred to as "LP1".
* The remaining 58 pages (17-74) were the large dump of images at end of the 2014 Puzzle, commonly referred to as "LP2".
  * Those images were released labeled 0-58 which can be confusing with LP1.
* We will combine both LP1 and LP2 into a single 0-74 sequence with hints on any page 17+.

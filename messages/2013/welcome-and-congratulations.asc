Welcome, and congratulations.  We have been pleased with your teamwork.

While teamwork is most important, we must also test you individually.  For this reason, we have devised a short written test.

In recognition of the fact that each individual contributes differently (and there is no "right" way to contribute), this test has no "right" or "wrong" answers.  It is designed to show us how you think and how resourceful you are.

Each question is timed, and any answer provided after the time has expired will not be accepted.  You are free to research the questions, but keep this time limit in mind.

Asking fellow participants or friends for help and/or their answers is not allowed.  Do not publish these questions.


At this time, we ask that you create a new email address to be used for communication for the rest of the challenge.  It should be:

   *  New
   *  Not associated with your identity in any way
   *  Created with a web-based email provider, not a temporary/disposable address
   *  Should not include identifying words (e.g., "cicada," "3301," etc).

You will also need to create a GPG key for use with this address and upload it to the keyservers.

Once you have completed the above, enter the email address below to receive your ID number.  Keep this ID number, as you will use it begin the test.

Each person may only register once.

Good luck.
